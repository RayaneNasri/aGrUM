Introduction to pyAgrum
=======================

`pyAgrum <https://forge.lip6.fr/projects/pyagrum/wiki>`_ is a Python wrapper for the C++ `aGrUM <https://agrum.lip6.fr>`_ library.
It provides a high-level interface to the part of aGrUM allowing to create, handle and make computations into Bayesian Networks.

The module is generated using the `SWIG <https://www.swig.org>`_ interface generator. Custom-written code was added to make
the interface more friendly.

pyAgrum contains
  * a `comprehensive API documentation <http://www-desir.lip6.fr/~phw/aGrUM/dev/pdoc/>`_,
  * `examples as notebooks <http://www-desir.lip6.fr/~phw/aGrUM/officiel/notebooks/>`_,
  * and a `website <https://forge.lip6.fr/projects/pyagrum/wiki>`_.
