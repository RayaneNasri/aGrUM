    Graphical model
      A probabilistic model for which a graph expresses the conditional dependence structure between random variables.

    Bayesian network
      A probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies in the form of a directed acyclic graph  (DAG).

    Markov random field
      A type of undirected graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies in the form of an undirected graph (UG).

    Influence diagram
      A type of graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies in the form of a directed acyclic graph.

    Limited memory influence diagram
      A type of influence diagram

    Credal network
      A type of graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies in the form of a directed acyclic graph with sets of probability distributions.

    Dynamic Bayesian network
      A type of graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies in the form of a directed acyclic graph that changes over (discrete) time. It is a generalisation of Markov Chain (with partial observation).

    Probabilistic relational model
      A type of graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies using graphs and patterns (such as relational databases, or Object Oriented programming language).
